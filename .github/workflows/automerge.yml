# Important notes:
#
# Automatic deletion of PR branches after merge is done through GitHub repository settings
# https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-the-automatic-deletion-of-branches
#
# "Require branches to be up to date before merging" is also enabled for the repository
#
# "check_suite" and "check_run" are not triggered for the GitHub Actions to prevent recusivity. More information
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#check_suite
# Also, it is impossible to trigger other workflows using the GitHub Actions default token for the same reasons.
#
# That's why, this workflow is triggered by the status that is posted on success from "CI" workflow.
